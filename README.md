## Hi there 👋

<div align="center">
Geospatial Science & Technology graduate from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, with a strong focus on 
GIS, Python development, and spatial problem-solving. Passionate about building practical geospatial tools,  
automating workflows, and turning complex data into clear, usable products. Aspiring to apply these skills  
within environmental, infrastructure, and public-lands work. Outside of GIS, I enjoy fly fishing in the Great Smoky Mountains  
and unwinding with a good thriller series.
